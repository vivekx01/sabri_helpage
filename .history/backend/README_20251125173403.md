# Sabri Helpage - Backend

This is a minimal Express + MongoDB backend scaffold for the Sabri Helpage project.

Features included:
- Express server (`server.js`)
- MongoDB connection using `mongoose` with `.env` config
- Models: `Teacher` and `Animal` (collections `teachers` and `animals`)
- Controllers and routes following the models/controllers/routes pattern
- Seeder (`seed.js`) that inserts sample teachers and animals if collections are empty
- Routes mounted under `/apixyz`:
  - `GET /apixyz/animals` - list animals
  - `GET /apixyz/teachers` - list teachers

Quick start
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `DB_URI` (or `MONGO_URI`) to your MongoDB connection string.

2. Install dependencies (run in `backend`):

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Seed database (optional):

```powershell
npm run seed
```

4. Start server:

```powershell
npm start
# or for development with nodemon
npm run dev
```

Server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

Troubleshooting
- If MongoDB is not reachable, ensure your `DB_URI` is correct and MongoDB is running.
- Use the `seed` command to populate sample data.
