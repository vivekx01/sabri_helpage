Next.js migration scaffold (proof of concept)

Run locally:

```powershell
cd next-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This is a minimal scaffold. I can now copy your Vite `src/components` and `src/pages` into `next-app/src/` and wire them into the App Router.
- Next steps: copy components, convert any browser-only code to client components, and update imports.
